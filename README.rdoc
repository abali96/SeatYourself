== SeatYourself - OpenTable Clone

Bitmaker Labs assignment: "SeatYourself" was the third Rails practical in the course, and the first which was completely tutorial-free.

Concepts reinforced in the development of SeatYourself were:

* Professional Rails application planning (user stories, mockups, modelling, usability)

* Debugging strategies

* Dates/Times in Rails

* ReST
